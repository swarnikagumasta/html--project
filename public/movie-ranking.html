<h1>The Best K-dramas According to Swarnika</h1>
<h2>My top 3 K-Drama of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>True Beauty</h3>
<p>It holds special place in my heart as it was my first K-Drama ,even though it might not be so popular among old kdrama fans but as it was my first time getting to know this amazing world of beautiful stories and unfelt emotions that i didn't know i can feel. </p>
<h3>My liberation notes</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a slow burn romance drama with a slice of life which will not be like any other typical kdrama , this is it for you.</p>
<h3>18 Again</h3>
<p>It was my that phase of life where I wanted to feel something the most, i was numb inside. It was such a good family drama with comedy ,romance and life . It was a fantasy drama but with reality check.</p>
